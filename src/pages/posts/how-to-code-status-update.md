I wanted to write a brief post to give all of you an update as to what I have been up to and why I have not posted any new articles in several months.

Back in April of 2021, I started a new job at [Cypress](https://cypress.io) as a Developer Experience (DX) Engineer. My team in particular is responsible for creating educational content around Cypress. Since I am now creating content full time, I have had less time to dedicate to this site. For example, one of the things we created were a series of tutorial videos on how to integrate Cypress with GitHub Actions. You can see those videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL8GlT7H3xOcLJMIPhxlZ8W9kgbeMqW7cH&v=USX6AntcPyg).

In addition to that, we have been creating a lot of content (over 70 articles!) related to testing that should be released very soon. I will be sure to update this site when it goes live.

That is it for now. I wanted to keep this very short and to the point. I will do my best to create new tutorials and content for this site, but for the time being, the majority of my content creation will be around Cypress for the time being.
